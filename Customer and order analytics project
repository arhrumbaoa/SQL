for this project of SQL, i created a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics of customer and order data

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20
---this query shows how many orders were placed in january---
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
---this shows how many iphone orders there were---
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
---this shows the customer account numbers for all orders in feburary---
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
--porducts that are the cheapeast and their price---
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
---the total revenue for each product sold in january---
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;
---the products sold in february at the address listed below---
SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;
---how many customers ordered more than two products at a time in feb and the average that was spent---
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
---learning how to dilter data by date---
SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00'

SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35'

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%'

SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%'

SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Price like '%.99'
---all the pdofucts in Los Angeles in February---
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FEbSales
WHERE location like '%LosAng0eles%'
GROUP BY product;
