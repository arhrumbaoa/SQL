for this project of SQL, i created a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics of customer and order data

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20
---this query shows how many orders were placed in january---
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
---this shows how many iphone orders there were---
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
---this shows the customer account numbers for all orders in feburary---
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
--porducts that are the cheapeast and their price---
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
---the total revenue for each product sold in january---
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;
---the products sold in february at the address listed below---
SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;
---how many customers ordered more than two products at a time in feb and the average that was spent---
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
